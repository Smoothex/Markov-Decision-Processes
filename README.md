implemented the Swarmmind behavior, if the Queen can't move in the desired direction of the player, the swarm also won't be able to move in 
the desired direction. The Game is also now considered as Lost, if the Queen is dead. - Phil 13/05/21

Changed file names, directory names, added coordinate systems, refactored fields, methods, functions, added comments - Kevin 20/05/21
